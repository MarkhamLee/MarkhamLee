### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data and machine learning engineer, with interests including Computer Vision, Custom PC Mods, Embedded & IoT devices, Kubernetes, Predictive Analytics and the data ingestion infrastructure(s) to support it. My repos are a mixture of things I'm building for professional development/to exhibit my skills and other projects that support my hobbies and/or projects around my home.
