### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data and machine learning engineer, whose focus areas/interests include: Computer Vision, Custom PC Mods, Embedded & IoT devices, Kubernetes and Predictive Analytics. My repos are a mixture of things I'm building for professional development/to exhibit my skills and projects that support my hobbies and/or things around my home. At the moment most of the things I'm building are either dockerized micro-services that I deploy/run on my mixed architecture (amd64/x86 and arm64) Kubernetes cluster/homelab, or are destined for home-brewed/DIY IoT devices built around either a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi or a microcontroller like the ESP32. While my primary languages are Python and R, I also have experience building micro-services with Node.js and have a more than passing familiarity with C++ and Java.
