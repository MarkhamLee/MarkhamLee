### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a data and machine learning engineer, whose professional areas of focus/interest areas include predictive analytics, computer vision for industrial applications and security, Kubernetes, embedded devices and IoT. My personal/hobbyist/maker interests include AgriTech, climate sensors, custom pc mods and home automation. My repos are a mixture of things I am building for professional development/to exhibit my skills and projects related to my personal interests. Most of the things I am currently building are either dockerized micro-services targeted for deployment on a mixed (amd64/x86 and arm64) Kubernetes cluster, and/or are destined for home-brewed/DIY IoT devices built around either a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi or a microcontroller like the ESP32. While my primary languages are Python and R, I also have experience building micro-services with Node.js and have a more than passing familiarity with C++ and Java. 

- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to/follow me on LinkedIn, I'm interested in discussing full time, contract, freelance and collaboration opportunities.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: data or machine learning related open-source projects, and hardware projects using Raspberry Pi single board computers (or similar) and microcontrollers like the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico.
